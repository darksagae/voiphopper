                              ALTERNATIVE
VoIP Hopper is a Kali Linux tool designed for penetration testing of VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) infrastructures, specifically to test the security of VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks). It can mimic the behavior of IP phones to identify and exploit vulnerabilities.

### How to Use VoIP Hopper

1.  **Installation:** VoIP Hopper is included in Kali Linux. If it's not already installed, you can install it via `apt`:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install voiphopper
    ```

2.  **Basic Usage:**

    *   Run VoIP Hopper with the interface option to start the tool. Replace `eth0` with your actual network interface.

        ```bash
        voiphopper -i eth0
        ```
3.  **VLAN Hopping:**

    *   VoIP Hopper works by creating a new Ethernet interface on your PC that tags the 802.1q VLAN header in the Ethernet packet.
    *   It supports multiple discovery protocols like DHCP, CDP, and LLDP-MED to find the voice VLAN ID (VVID).
    *   After creating the new interface, it sends a DHCP client request to get an IP address in the VoIP VLAN subnet.

### Examples and Output

1.  **Running VoIP Hopper in Assessment Mode:**

    *   This mode helps in discovering devices on the VoIP VLAN.

        ```bash
        voiphopper -i eth0 -z
        ```

    *   The tool will start capturing packets and analyzing ARP packets on the specified interface. It will display any new hosts learned on the interface, including their MAC and IP addresses.

        ```
        Main Sniffer: capturing packets on eth0
        Analyzing ARP packets on default interface: eth0
        New host #1 learned on eth0: (MAC): 78:ca:39:fe:0b:4c (IP): 192.168.1.229
        New host #2 learned on eth0: (MAC): 60:6b:bd:5a:b6:6c (IP): 192.168.1.213
        New host #3 learned on eth0: (MAC): 40:6c:8f:1b:cb:90 (IP): 192.168.1.232
        ```
2.  **Discovering the Voice VLAN and Hopping Into It:**

    *   Launch `voiphopper` on the appropriate interface, faking a Cisco model 7940 phone.

        ```bash
        voiphopper -i eth0 -f cisco-7940
        ```

    *   It automatically discovers the voice VLAN ID, hops into this VLAN by creating a subinterface tagged with the VLAN ID (e.g., `eth0.323`), performs a DHCP request, and sends CDP packets to maintain the presence of a Cisco phone.

### Notes

*   VoIP Hopper mimics IP phone behavior to discover the voice VLAN and gain unauthorized access.
*   It can generate CDP messages like an IP phone.
*   The tool supports various environments, including Cisco, Avaya, Nortel, and Alcatel-Lucent.
*   Use this tool responsibly and ethically, only on networks you have permission to test.
